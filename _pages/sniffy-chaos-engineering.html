    <p>Discover all outgoing network connections from your server and disable them right from your browser</p>

    <p>Sniffy will throw a java.net.ConnectException when your application tries to connect to address disallowed by Sniffy. It’s also possible to specify a fixed delay for all sent and received TCP packets.</p>
