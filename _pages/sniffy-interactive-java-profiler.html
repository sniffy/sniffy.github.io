    <h4>Why another profiler?</h4>
    <p>Why do you need another Java profiler? I believe in shift-left approach - engineers must be able to test their code as early as possible.</p>
    <p>Unlike conventional profiler tools, Sniffy injects a tiny widget HTML widget directly to your pages.</p>
    <p>It shows the time it took to generate current page and any of requests made from this page. Sniffy shows time to first byte and time to last byte as seen by server, i.e. for example excluding TLS handshake - it allows you to focus on your application performance rather than on your test infrastructure</p>
    <p>Apart from time to first byte, Sniffy give you insight into what downstream systems do you use, what SQL queries do you run, how many TCP round-trips do they involve, etc.</p>

    <h4>Further reading</h4>
    <p>While Sniffy Widget is extremelly helpgull for investigations and exploratary testing, you should also invest into your test automation.</p>
    <p>Sniffy allows you to <a href="/sniffy-verify-number-of-sql-queries-in-unit-tests/">verify number of SQL queries generated by your application or number of rows returned right in your unit tests</a>.</p>
    <p>Assertions on generic TCP operations are also available.</p>
